## Description

The challenge is to create a simple application in React Native that includes the following functionalities:

- A "tasks" section, which is a simple list of tasks added by the user (only containing a description), with the option to add more tasks.
- A "list" section, which will simply make a request to a remote data list and render it on the screen.

The main screen contains 2 buttons used to navigate to the screens of each of the mentioned sections.

## Functionalities

- Tasks:
  - Create a list of tasks in a Redux context.
  - Read and display data present in Redux.
  - Add new tasks via a modal with a form.
  - Validation to prevent adding tasks with empty descriptions.
  - Persist tasks when navigating between screens.
- List:
  - Display a list of items fetched from a remote data source.
  - Display at least the name of each item and optionally an image in the "contact list" style.
  - Show a loading state while fetching the data.

## Architecture

This project uses Redux Toolkit for global state management and Axios for HTTP requests.

This codebase follows the Hexa3 architecture, which is a combination of Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This architecture promotes a clean separation of concerns and a modular design, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
